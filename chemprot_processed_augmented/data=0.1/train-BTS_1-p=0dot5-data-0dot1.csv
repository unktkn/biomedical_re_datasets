In addition, a combinatorial mutation ( Pro(7.31)-Pro(7.32)-ser(7.33)-motiv to Ser-Glu-Pro in EL3 and Leu(7.38 ), @CHEMICAL$(7.43 ), Ala(7.46) and Pro(7.47) against those of the rat GnRHR ) in gmGnRH-2 showed an approximately 500-fold increased sensitivity to GnRH-I, suggesting that these residues are critical for the differentiation of GnRH-II from GnRH-I. [TRP(7)]GnRH-I and [TRP(8)]GnRH-I do not show a higher potency in the activation of wild species gmGnRHR-2 than native GnRH-I, indicating that amino acids at positions 7 and 8 of GnRH-I do not show a higher potency in the activation of wild species gmGnRHR-2 than native GnRH-I. @GENE$ are more important than position 5 for differential recognition by type I and type II GnRHRs .	false
