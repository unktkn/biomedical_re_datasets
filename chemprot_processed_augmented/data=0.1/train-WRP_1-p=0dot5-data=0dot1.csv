Abstract 1.  @CHEMICAL$-glucuronosyltransferases (@GENE$) are versatile and important conjugation enzymes in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. 2.

We have used this method to screen 11 recombinant human UGTs for HFC glucuronidation activity and studied the reaction kinetics with the most active enzymes.	false
