HDL-@CHEMICAL$ decreased in OO ; @GENE$ increase and lipoprotein ( a ) decreased in therefore ; alpha-tocopherol/cholesterol ratio increased in OO ; malondialdehyde decreased in both radical ; IL-2 increased in both groups .	false
bandaging experiments on @CHEMICAL$ , nateglinide , and repaglinide to SUR1 show in COS-1 cells revealed that they inhibit the attach of [3H]glibenclamide to @GENE$ ( IC50 values : mitiglinide , 280 micromillimeter ; nateglinide , eighter from Decatur microM ; repaglinide , 1.6 microM ) , paint a picture that they all partake in a glibenclamide obligate site .	false
The P2Y1 receptor is responsible for ADP-induced shape change and weak and transient aggregation, while the @GENE$ receptor is responsible for the completion and amplification of the response to @CHEMICAL$ and to all platelet agonists, including thromboxane A2 (TXA2), thrombin, and collagen.	false
@CHEMICAL$ was significantly less potent in the DAT Y156F mutant compared with wild-type @GENE$, whereas S-modafinil was affected less.	false
On days 0 and 35 , affected role ' nutritional status was assessed by BMI , normalized protein katabolic rank , predialytic @CHEMICAL$ , serum albumen and transthyretin ; lipid metabolism by plasm LDL- and HDL-cholesterol , triacylglycerols , phospholipids , apo A-I , A-II , atomic number 5 , C-II , C-III , E and @GENE$ ; oxidative status by alpha-tocopherol , retinol , atomic number 34 , glutathione peroxidase , malondialdehyde and advanced oxidate protein mathematical product ; inflammatory position by blood serum C-reactive protein , orosomucoid , IL-2 and IL-6 .	false
