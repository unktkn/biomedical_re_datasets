indium further studies , the diuretic effect of the @GENE$ agonist AM4054 were similar in male and female rats , displayed a comparatively speedy oncoming to action , and were dose-dependently antagonized by 30 instant pretreatment with rimonabant , but not by the vanilloid sensory receptor type I resister capsazepine , nor were the effects of pull ahead 55,212 antagonize by the CB2 antagonist AM630 [ @CHEMICAL$ ] .	false
Methanandamide ( 10.0 mg/kg ) had lesser consequence than other CB agonists , and the @GENE$ agonist AM1241 [ 1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-3-(2-iodo-5-nitrobenzoyl)indole ] , the anandamide rapture inhibitor @CHEMICAL$ , and the CB opposer rimonabant did not have diuretic effects .	CPR:5
Agents that have only start to undergo clinical evaluation include CI-1033 , an irreversible pan-erbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor , and @CHEMICAL$ and GW572016 , both examples of duple kinase inhibitor ( subdue epidermal ontogeny factor sense organ and @GENE$ ) .	CPR:4
In this study, we examined the effects of @CHEMICAL$ on various cloned K(ATP) channels (Kir6.2/SUR1, Kir6.2/SUR2A, and Kir6.2/@GENE$) reconstituted in COS-1 cells, and compared them to another meglitinide-related compound, nateglinide.	false
Mutation of arginine 228 to lysine enhances the @GENE$ natural process of bovine beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase I. Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase iodine ( beta4Gal-T1 ) normally transfers gallon from UDP-Gal to GlcNAc in the presence of Mn(2 + ) ion ( @CHEMICAL$-T activity ) and likewise transfers Glc from UDP-Glc to GlcNAc ( Glc-T bodily process ) , albeit at only 0.3 % efficiency .	false
Inhibition of @GENE$ @CHEMICAL$ receptors could stand for a central mechanism rudimentary the anticonvulsant activity of topiramate .	false
Mutation of arginine 228 to @CHEMICAL$ enhances the glucosyltransferase activity of @GENE$. Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase I (beta4Gal-T1) normally transfers Gal from UDP-Gal to GlcNAc in the presence of Mn(2+) ion (Gal-T activity) and also transfers Glc from UDP-Glc to GlcNAc (Glc-T activity), albeit at only 0.3% efficiency.	false
This study demonstrates enhanced cardiostimulation by @CHEMICAL$ (in the presence of propranolol) in rat ventricular myocytes overexpressing beta(1)-adrenoceptors, mediated by a @GENE$/cAMP signalling pathway. 'Putative' beta(4)-adrenoceptor pharmacology appears to be mediated by activation of a novel affinity state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor.	false
@CHEMICAL$ aminopeptidase-2 (@GENE$) is a novel target for cancer therapy.	false
This analyse manifest enhanced cardiostimulation by CGP 12177A ( in the bearing of propranolol ) in rat ventricular myocytes overexpressing beta(1)-adrenoceptors , intercede by a @GENE$/@CHEMICAL$ signalling pathway . ' Putative ' beta(4)-adrenoceptor pharmacology come along to be mediate by activation of a new kinship express of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor .	false
Mutation of @CHEMICAL$ 228 to lysine enhances the glucosyltransferase activity of bovid beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase I. Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase i ( @GENE$ ) normally transfers gal from UDP-Gal to GlcNAc in the presence of Mn(2 + ) ion ( Gal-T activity ) and likewise channelise Glc from UDP-Glc to GlcNAc ( Glc-T activity ) , albeit at only 0.3 % efficiency .	false
@CHEMICAL$ mediates cardiostimulation by activation of the ' putative ' @GENE$ ; withal , it has recently been cover that disruption of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor gene abolish this effect .	CPR:3
